    <h2>Charley Yang (Character)</h2>
    <br>
    <h3>Charley Yang is the real name of the American singer, songwriter, and producer behind the alt-pop persona BoyWithUke. Born in Massachusetts, Yang is a classically trained musician who taught himself music production and rose to fame through platforms like TikTok and SoundCloud. With a background in orchestral music and a deep-rooted interest in storytelling, he crafted the BoyWithUke project as both a creative outlet and a form of emotional armor.

        In BoyWithUke lore, Charley Yang exists almost as the ghost behind the mask — a figure defined by introspection, vulnerability, and anonymity. Donning a glowing LED mask to conceal his identity, the BoyWithUke persona became a symbolic character representing emotional repression, social anxiety, and the yearning to be heard without being seen. Early in his career, Yang chose to stay anonymous to avoid judgment and to let his music speak louder than his face. This choice became a fundamental part of the mythos: a faceless voice navigating heartbreak, isolation, mental health struggles, and the quiet intensity of growing up.
        
        As time went on, the lines between Charley Yang and BoyWithUke began to blur. With the release of Lucid Dreams in 2023, Yang removed the mask, revealing himself to the public and initiating a new chapter in his artistry. The moment symbolized transformation — shedding the protective shell and stepping into the world unfiltered. In the BoyWithUke universe, this act marked a turning point from the dreamlike escapism of past records (Melatonin Dreams, Fever Dreams, Serotonin Dreams) into a more self-actualized, grounded perspective.
        
        Today, Charley Yang is recognized not just as the mind behind BoyWithUke, but as a fully realized artist in his own right — one who continues to blend narrative, emotion, and sonic experimentation while chronicling his journey from masked anonymity to honest visibility.</h3>

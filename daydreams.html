    <h2>Day Dreams (BoyWithUke Album)</h2>
    <br>
    <h3>Day Dreams is a rumored compilation album by American alt-pop artist BoyWithUke. While not officially announced, the album is speculated to be a collection of unreleased tracks that didn't make it onto his previous albums. Fans have discussed the potential tracklist, which includes songs like "Affection," "Blind," "Collard Shirt," "Green," "Tension," "Friends," "Enigma," and "Dear, Hollywood." These tracks were reportedly mentioned during a live session by BoyWithUke, where he previewed them from his computer.

        The album is anticipated to serve as a "retirement album," possibly marking the end of BoyWithUke's musical releases under this moniker. Fans speculate that it will include approximately 15 tracks, featuring both unreleased songs and full versions of popular snippets from his Minute-Long Songs series, such as "Greener," "Hopeless Romantic," and "Runaway."
        
        The title Day Dreams aligns with the thematic naming convention of BoyWithUke's previous albums, including Melatonin Dreams, Fever Dreams, Serotonin Dreams, and Lucid Dreams. However, it's important to note that the album's existence and details remain speculative, with no official confirmation from the artist.</h3>

    <h5>This album is not available on Spotify.. yet.</h5>
